# Acing the Software Engineering Interview

For a while now I am having second thoughts on pursuing a career in the software industry. I did not roll into it naturally with a degree in CS. I initially pursued a degree in Business before I made the switch to Business & Information Technology. I discovered the wonderful world of Machine Learning along the way and slowly drifted towards becoming a Data Scientist / Software Engineer. Yet, since leaving college I have done little with either. I have a high paying job at a defense contractor, but due to the nature of working on an established application my abilities are hardly utilized. I am a software developer not an engineer - it’s time to do something about.
For some time, I have been interested on becoming a fully developed Data Scientist and Software Engineer. Recently I came across John Washam’s blog and GitHub page on how to ace the interview at a big company and decided I want do the same. However, John readily admits he made a few mistakes that he would undo if he could. I intend to learn from them, and I hope you will too.
This list of items will prepare you for becoming a Software Engineer and a Data Scientist at any software company. And just like John Washam’s aim high attitude, that includes Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.
So essentially this list is structured into 2 knowledge parts: must know knowledge for being a Software Engineer and an introduction to Machine Learning.
The list includes references to texts, web pages, YouTube videos, MOOCs and Books. I intend to go easy on reading books and just give you the essential list. Reading takes up a lot of time and I fear knowledge is not retained. The scope of this list is also paired down as much as possible. 

## Short description of Goals

### Things I want to achieve
	- Go through all the relevant subject material - even stuff I already know. By proceeding through all the material over a period of several months may help me understand the big picture of Computer Science.
	- Code a lot. I want to implement all the relevant examples of algorithms, data structures and applications to gain practical experience.
	- Test a lot. Code testing is laborious, boring but absolutely necessary. As this guide primarily deals with Java I will write test code using Junit and Mockito.
	- Retain as much knowledge as possible. Try and find a way to retain the knowledge.
	- Learn practical tips to becoming a Software Engineer. This means practicing for the interview, deals with issues such as fear and how to work in an Agile / SCRUM way.

### Things I don’t want to do
	- Spend all of my free time on becoming a Software Engineer. John Washam admits he spent far too much time on this project. Currently I have a job and I don’t need a burnout.
	- Lose overview. There is such a thing as doing too much. Knowing when to stop is important and I will put that to the test.
	- Not to be afraid to re-invent the wheel. The goal is not to do something new, the goal is to learn to do something new.

## Interview Process & General Interview Prep
Here are some quick tutorials and tips to prepare for the interview process. I think it will give you a quick impression of what you don’t know!

- [ ] [ABC - Always Be Coding](https://medium.com/always-be-coding/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2)
- [ ] [Whiteboarding](https://writing.pupius.co.uk/whiteboarding-4df873dbba2e)
- [ ] [Demystifying Tech Recruiting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N233T0epWTs)

## Pick a language
For the interview you will need to select one programming language. I have made the choice for you as I use Java. However, you will need to know more. You will also need to know a scripting language. The obvious choice is Python, which is also popular with Machine Learning.

## Book List
### Introductory
- [ ] [Linux, Programming and Hacking for Beginners](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0CF3L5)
    - This is a book that I wrote. It is an abolute beginneers text to Linux, with some programmign and Hacking. The text is written in a light-hearted tone and a number of side articles in which I explain topics of Computer Science. I also review several movies, games and books in which CS plays an important part. For $3.99 you pick up your own copy on Amazon and thereby support me.
### Java
	- Algorithms (Sedgewick and Wayne)
### Python
	- An introduction to Programming in Python (Sedgewick, Wayne and Dondero)

## Software Engineering
### Basics of Java

### Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis
	- Cheat sheet: http://bigocheatsheet.com/ also exists as a PDF in this repository.

### Data Structures
For the study of data structures and algorithms a three-pronged approach is used. First, a short descriptive video is linked (usually YouTube). Second, a simple implementation is referenced which the reader can examine. Third and finally a short descriptive text is linked in which the topic is discussed.
	
- [ ] Arrays: understand the (speed) difference between a static array and a dynamic (of type) Array.

### Graphs
Graphs are an important aspect in Computer Science. Many problems can be explained and solved as Graphs. An example would be social networks, personal relations can be seen as graph edges.

Graphs can be represented as

	- Adjancency Matrix
	- Adjency List
	
Graphs can be traversed with algorithms such as:

- [ ] Breadth-first search
- [ ] Depth-first search
- [ ] Dijkstra's algorithm

	### More Programming languages
The coding interviews taking by large companies usually concentrate on just one language. The interviewee can choose form a small: usually C, Java or Python. However, there is a much larger world involving databases and web programming. Knowing other languages becomes vital – just not for the interview. Try and choose from the list below.
