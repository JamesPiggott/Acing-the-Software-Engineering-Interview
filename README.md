# Acing the Software Engineering Interview

For a while now I am having second thoughts on pursuing a career in the software industry. I did not roll into it naturally with a degree in CS. I initially pursued a degree in Business before I made the switch. I discovered the wonderful world of Machine Learning drifted towards becoming a Data Scientist / Software Engineer. Yet, since leaving college I have done little with either. I have a high paying job at a defense contractor, but due to the nature of working on an established application my abilities are hardly utilized. I am a software developer not an engineer - it’s time to do something about that!
For some time, I have wanted become a fully developed Data Scientist and Software Engineer. Recently I came across John Washam’s blog and GitHub page on how to 'ace the interview' at a big tech company and decided I want do the same. However, John readily admits he made a few mistakes. I intend to learn from them, and I hope you will too.
This list of items will prepare you for becoming a Software Engineer and a Data Scientist. And just like John Washam’s 'aim high' attitude, that includes Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.
So essentially this list is structured into 2 knowledge parts: must know knowledge for being a Software Engineer and an introduction to Machine Learning.
The list includes references to texts, web pages, YouTube videos, MOOCs and Books. I intend to go easy on reading books and just give you the essential list. Reading takes up a lot of time and I fear knowledge is not retained. The scope of this list is also paired down as much as possible. However, I should you practice coding for as much as possible.

## Short description of Goals

### Things I want to achieve
	- Go through all the relevant subject material - even stuff I already know. By proceeding through all the material over a period of several months may help me understand the big picture of Computer Science.
	- Code a lot. I want to implement all the relevant examples of algorithms, data structures and applications to gain practical experience.
	- Test a lot. Code testing is laborious, boring but absolutely necessary. As this guide primarily deals with Java I will write test code using Junit and Mockito.
	- Retain as much knowledge as possible. Try and find a way to retain the knowledge.
	- Learn practical tips to becoming a Software Engineer. This means practicing for the interview, deal with issues such as fear, my introvertedness and how to work in an Agile / SCRUM way.

### Things I don’t want to do
	- Spend all of my free time on becoming a Software Engineer. John Washam admits he spent far too much time on his project. Currently I have a job and I don’t need a burnout.
	- Lose overview. There is such a thing as doing too much. Knowing when to stop is important and I will put that to the test.
	- Not to be afraid to re-invent the wheel. The goal is not to do something new, the goal is to learn to do something new.

## Interview Process & General Interview Prep
Here are some quick tutorials and tips to prepare for the interview process. I think it will give you a quick impression of what you don’t know!

## Pick a language
For the interview you will need to select one programming language. I have made the choice for you as I use Java. However, you will need to know more. You will also need to know a scripting language. The obvious choice is Python, which is also popular with Machine Learning.
As such there are coding example in both Java and Python(https://github.com/JamesPiggott/PythonSoftwareEngineeringInterview)

## Book List

### Graphs
Graphs are an important aspect in Computer Science. Many problems can be explained and solved as Graphs.
- [ ] [Sedgewick: 9 minute introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_-qGQgzBLg&t=331s)

Graphs can be represented as

	- [ ] [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/683041/java-how-do-i-use-a-priorityqueue)
	
Graphs are a complicated topic. The algorithms to traverse them are not easy to implement. If you find it difficult to use the videos and texts above then sign up for a MOOC course. 2 years ago I did [Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented). It really helped me see the big picture. The third course in the specialization (Advanced Data Structures in Java) is on Graphs.

### Advanced Java

### Deep Learning
Deep Learning is quickly becoming a craze, and I think it is deservedly so. For an excellent but easy introduction read Python Deep Learning. There is a link above. For specific applications I have posted links below
- [ ] [Cheat Sheets](https://becominghuman.ai/cheat-sheets-for-ai-neural-networks-machine-learning-deep-learning-big-data-678c51b4b463)

At this moment there are a number of ways to implement Deep Learning on datasets: Theano, Tensorflow and Keras to name a few. Below is an introductory video.
- [ ] [Deep Learning Frameworks Compared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDP9FfsNx60)

#### Keras
The easiest way to quickly learn how to program Deep Learning solutions is through Keras. Developed by Francois Chollet at Google it is layer on top of Theano or TensorFlow - the two main frameworks used. Below are a set of easy to follow tutorials that culminate in a solution designed to be scalable and which can be accessed through an REST Api.

- [ ] [Advanced REST API (scalable, message queuing)](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/01/29/scalable-keras-deep-learning-rest-api/)

There are also a number of books on Keras. Note that Keras is still very new - yet it is quickly being adopted.
- [ ] [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1523989891&sr=8-1&keywords=francois+chollet)
	- Written by Francois Chollet himself. The book is practically new (October 2017), but is already considered the bible to Keras. It is also easy to work with

All topics above are about using Deep Learning with Python. It shows you why Python is so important.

#### Vectorization
With Vectorization we can greatly increase the number of operations per instruction - that is, reduce the number of loop iterations because we do more per loop. With Machine Learning using Linear Algebra this has become vital to optimize resources.

## Practicing for the Interview
After learning many of the topics described in the sections on Software Engineering and Machine Learning you should have a well rounded knowledge base. To get actually get a job at the company of your choice you will need to ace the interview. This section will concentrate on all that is necessary to accomplish just that. If you want to continue learning take a look at the section below entitled Other Topics.

### Coding Exercises
If you are uncertain how well you can code when facing an unexpected challenge try a coding challenge. Seriously there are plenty of online challenge sites.

	- This books by Georgia Weidman has been a favorite of mine since 2014. It is both both broad and in-depth and covers most topics regarding computer hacking.

### More Programming languages
The coding interviews taking by tech companies usually concentrate on just one language. The interviewee can choose from a small selection: usually C, Java or Python. However, there is a much larger world involving databases and web programming. Knowing other languages becomes vital – just not for the interview. As an option choose one of the languages to round out your skills. I choose the Go programming language.
